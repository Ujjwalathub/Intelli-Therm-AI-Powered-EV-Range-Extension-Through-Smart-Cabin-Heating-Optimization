### **About The Project**

This project introduces **Intelli-Therm**, an intelligent, real-time heating optimization strategy designed to maximize Electric Vehicle (EV) driving range with a minimal, imperceptible impact on passenger comfort. By leveraging machine learning, Intelli-Therm tackles one of the most significant barriers to EV adoption: range anxiety, especially in winter conditions.

#### **Problem Statement**

Cabin heating systems in electric vehicles can drastically reduce driving range by up to **40% in cold weather**. This unpredictability is a major concern for drivers and a hurdle for the widespread adoption of sustainable transportation.

#### **Solution: The Intelli-Therm Strategy**

Intelli-Therm employs a predictive algorithm based on the concept of **"peak power shaving"**.
- It uses a trained **XGBoost Regressor model** to predict the vehicle's powertrain energy demand 5-10 seconds into the future.
- When the model anticipates a high-demand phase, like sudden acceleration, the algorithm strategically and momentarily reduces heating power by a small, imperceptible amount (e.g., 15%).
- During low-demand phases, such as cruising or regenerative braking, the system can compensate for the slight reduction.

This process smooths the overall load on the battery, enhancing its efficiency and extending the vehicle's operational range.

### **Features**

- **Predictive Power Management**: Forecasts short-term energy demand from the powertrain.
- **Dynamic Heating Control**: Intelligently modulates heater power based on real-time driving behavior.
- **Peak Power Shaving**: Reduces battery load during high-demand events to improve efficiency.
- **Data-Driven**: Trained on the comprehensive "Battery and Heating Data in Real Driving Cycles" dataset.
- **Validated Performance**: Proven to extend EV range by approximately **7% in -10°C conditions** through simulation.

### **Technology Stack**

- **Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### **Dataset**

The project is built upon the **"Battery and Heating Data in Real Driving Cycles"** dataset from IEEE DataPort. This dataset was chosen for its detailed focus on the interplay between real-world driving, battery performance, and the heating circuit of a BMW i3. It includes:
- **Measurement Data**: Time-series data from 72 real-world driving trips, used for model training.
- **Simulation Data**: Data from a validated model under various controlled conditions, used for testing and validating the Intelli-Therm strategy.

---

### **Methodology**

The project followed a structured four-phase methodology:

1.  **Data Consolidation & EDA**: All 72 trip files were merged into a master DataFrame. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed strong correlations between throttle/speed and battery current, validating the core problem.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: Critical new features were created, including:
    - `powertrain_load_W`: Calculated as `battery_voltage_V * battery_current_A`.
    - `acceleration` and `throttle_change_rate`: To capture vehicle dynamics.
    - **Lagged Features**: To give the model a "memory" of the immediate past state of the vehicle.
3.  **Predictive Modeling**: An **XGBoost Regressor** was trained to predict `powertrain_load_W` 5-10 seconds in the future. The dataset was split by trips to ensure a realistic testing scenario and prevent data leakage.
4.  **Intelli-Therm Control Algorithm**: The core algorithm uses the model's predictions. If the predicted load exceeds a defined `HIGH_POWER_THRESHOLD` (the 90th percentile), it temporarily reduces heating power.

### **Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://your-repository-url/Intelli-Therm.git
    cd Intelli-Therm
    ```
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn tqdm
    ```
3.  Download the dataset from [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/battery-and-heating-data-real-driving-cycles) and place the `Measurement Data` folder in the project's root directory.

---

### **Usage**

1.  Open the `intelli_therm_model.py` script.
2.  Update the `measurement_data_path` variable to point to the location of your `Measurement Data` folder:
    ```python
    measurement_data_path = r"path/to/your/Measurement Data"
    ```
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python intelli_therm_model.py
    ```
The script will automatically load the data, perform feature engineering, train the model, and run a simulation to validate the results.

### **Validation and Results**

The Intelli-Therm algorithm was validated by replaying a cold-weather simulation scenario (`-10°C`) twice: once with the standard heating profile and once with the active Intelli-Therm algorithm.

- The analysis demonstrated a **~7% extension in the vehicle's range**.
- The final dashboard visualization clearly showed the algorithm reducing heating power during high acceleration, resulting in a slower depletion of the battery's state of charge compared to the baseline.
